# StratifiedKFold-with-Pytorch

Code to achieve StratifiedKFold using Pytorch datasets and dataloaders.

Data is not added to repository, it is needed to add your own data to make it work.

The dataset that was used to test if code worked is from the Kaggle competition [Paddy Doctor: Paddy Disease Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/paddy-disease-classification)
